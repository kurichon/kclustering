# kclustering
Simple K-clustering algorithm implementation and visualization without the use of libraries

This code generates random samples everytime it is executed based on the sampleCount value. Number of clusters can also be changed by changing the value of the k variable.

For the color, you can add more colors depending on how many clusters you want to experiment on. The number of colors written on this code only supports up to k = 4.

If the code does not finish looping after 50 iterations, the program will forcefully terminate.
